# TriviaGame
A trivia game utilizing jQuery and interval timers.

Users attempt to answer 10 Hayao Miyazaki trivia questions in under 30 seconds. When the time is up their correct answers are added and they are shown one of three screens based on their score: "not so hot", "a fan", or a "bonafide hustler."
